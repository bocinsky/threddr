Title: Access to THREDDS Servers
Description: THREDDS data servers are webservers that provide access to gridded data—
  in the form of NetCDF files—via a handy RESTful API (among other protocols). 
  THREDDS servers not only serve data, but provide tools for subsetting gridded data 
  in space and time on the server, reducing the amount of data the end user must download. 
  The thredds package is an R front end to THREDDS servers designed to make exploration, 
  subsetting, and download of THREDDS data into R as simple as possible.
